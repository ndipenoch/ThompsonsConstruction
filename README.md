Once you lunch Python a GUI window will pop up.
You will have 2 alternatives, to either enter your inputs via entry boxes or read them from a file using file choosers/selectors.
Your input strings should be separated by commas ",".

If you decide to use the entry boxes, then the Infix field is mandatory or else you get a warning message displayed in the output
box saying "Infix Field Must be Filled!".
After entry your input in both Infix and String fields, click on the button "SUBMIT" and your output will be display in the output box.

If you decide to read the Input from files, then you have to click on both the "Select InFix File" and "Select String File" buttons.
Upon clicking each of these buttons a file selector window will pop out to allow you to choose a file from your directory. The default 
file format is set up as ".txt" but you can change it to all file types.

Once you select both files, you can then click on the button "VALIDATE" and your out put will be displayed in the output box.

If you don't select any file and click on the validate button these error message "You Must select An Infix And String Files!" will be displayed in the output box.

If you select both files and the Infix file is empty, you will see this error message "The Infix File is Empty!" in the output box.

The strings in both files must be separated by commas, ",".

Also, you can hard code the inputs directly in the code and the output will be displayed in the console window.
